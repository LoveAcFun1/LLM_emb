{"input": "Treatment with I-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1-1.5 mg daily , within 4 weeks ) led to normalization of total and ionized form of Ca2+ and of 25 ( OH ) D , but did not affect the PTH content in blood .", "output": "None"}
{"input": "Concentration of the receptors to 1.25 ( OH ) 2D3 was elevated up to 39.7 fmole/mg after I week of the treatment , whereas it was decreased to the initial level 24.8 fmole/mg within 4 weeks ; simultaneous alteration in the cAMP content was observed in lymphocytes .", "output": "protein: receptors; cell type: lymphocytes"}
